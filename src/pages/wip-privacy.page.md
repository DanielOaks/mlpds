This is a WIP Privacy page so it's not complete or in use. This text hasn't been written by a lawyer so if you're expecting exacting, legally-binding text here then ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ soz (sorry). But I'll do my best to explain what data the site collects, how to see it, and how to remove your data.

This page tells you what data the MLPDS website collects, how to see your data, how to remove your data, and other information about how this project respects your privacy.


## Info You Share With Us

When you sign up for an account, you share this information with us:

- **Discord Account**: We use your Discord account to confirm that you're a part of the MLPDS Discord Guild. It's also used as a possible login method. In particular, we save your Discord Account Identifier (the `snowflake` ID), and then link it to your site account.
- **MLPDS Discord Guild Membership**: On account registration we confirm that you're on the MLPDS Discord guild and save:
  - Which admin/moderation role(s) your Discord account has in the guild.
  - Whether you've signed up for 18+ content in the guild.
  - During the account registration process we temporarily save your MLPDS Guild Membership Object, which contains this information: https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild#guild-member-object <br>We process and then delete this information when your account is actually created – or just delete it after a short time if the account creation request isn't completed.
  - We update the above information from time-to-time, confirming that you're still a member of the guild and updating your roles/18+ access.
- **ID**: How we refer to you on the site, in site/file links, etc.
- **Name**: What we call you on the site and the name others see for you.

Here's other information you can share with us while using the site:

- **Created characters**: We save: the character's name, rating, description, and any other info you give us while creating or updating characters.
- **Uploaded files/art**: When uploading files or art we save: the filename, the fact you uploaded it, as well as the name, description, and rating you give it.
